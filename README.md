## Overview

Happy Foundation package is a collection of modules to support better KMP development, or just Android-based development in general.
KMP is used to both keep the content honest (no Android specifics in common), but also to support multiplatform development across
iOS/Android/Desktop/Web

Each of the modules here have their own documentation so be sure to click through

## Status

*More to come!* Some code is being cleaned up, unit tested added, and maven deployments are being
reworked. This code was part of a large (private to me) project I'm pulling useful parts out of.
